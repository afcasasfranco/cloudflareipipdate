This is a Python Script to always have your ip updated on the type A DNS register on Cloude Flare
You can have multiple DNS Zone an multiple Type A registar to update, on the same way you can select what type a register the script not update and keep with the same ip.
#Enjoy
I need to give credit to pigeonburger his scrip was the base to create this, you can check on https://github.com/pigeonburger/cloudflare-ip/blob/main/cfautoupdater.py
